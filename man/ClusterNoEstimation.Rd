Estimates Number of Clusters using up to 26 Indicators
}
\description{
Calculation of up to 26 indicators and the recommendations based on them for the number of clusters in data sets. 
For a given dataset and clusterings for this dataset, key indicators mentioned in details are calculated and based on this a recommendation regarding the number of classes is given for each indicator.

An alternative estimation of the cluster number can be done by counting the valleys of the topographic map of the generalized U-Matrix for a specfic projection method using the \pkg{ProjectionBasesdClustering} and \pkg{GeneralizedUmatrix} packages on CRAN, see [Thrun/Ultsch, 2021] for details.

\usage{
ClusterNoEstimation(DataOrDistances, ClsMatrix = NULL, max.nc, 

index = "all", min.nc = 2,

Silent = TRUE, method = NULL, 
PlotIt=FALSE,SelectByABC=TRUE,Colorsequence)
}
\arguments{
  \item{DataOrDistances}{
    Either [1:n,1:d] matrix of dataset to be clustered. It consists of n cases of d-dimensional data points. Every case has d attributes, variables or features.
    
    or

Symmetric [1:n,1:n] distance matrix
  }
  \item{ClsMatrix}{
[1:n,1:(max.nc)] matrix of clusterings each columns is defined as: 

1:n numerical vector of numbers defining the classification as the main output of the clustering algorithm for the n cases of data. It has k unique numbers representing the arbitrary labels of the clustering.

(see also details (2) and (3)), must be specified if method = NULL
  }
  \item{max.nc}{
    Highest number of classes to be checked
  }
  \item{method}{
    Cluster procedure, with which the clusterings are created (see details (4) for possible methods), must be specified if ClsMatrix = NULL
	}
  Optional:
  \item{index}{
 String or vector of strings with the indicators to be calculated (see details (1)), default = "all
  }
  \item{min.nc}{
   Lowest number of classes to be checked, default = 2
  }
  \item{Silent}{
      If TRUE status messages are output, default = FALSE
  }
    \item{PlotIt}{
      If TRUE plots fanplot with proposed cluster numbers
  }
      \item{SelectByABC}{
      If PlotIt=TRUE, TRUE: Plots group A of ABCanalysis of the most important ones (highest overlap in indicators), FALSE: plots all indicators
  }
        \item{Colorsequence}{
    Optional, character vector of sufficient length of colors for the fan plot.If the sequence is too long the first part of the sequence is used.
  }
}
\details{
Each column of \code{ClsMatrix} has to have at least two unqiue clusters defined. Otherwise the function will stop.

(1)

The following 26 indicators can be calculated:
"ball", "beale", "calinski", "ccc", "cindex", "db", "duda", 
"dunn", "frey", "friedman", "hartigan", "kl", "marriot", "mcclain", 
"pseudot2", "ptbiserial", "ratkowsky", "rubin", "scott", "sdbw", 
"sdindex", "silhouette", "ssi", "tracew", "trcovw", "xuindex".

These can be specified individually or as a vector via the parameter index.
If you enter 'all', all key figures are calculated.

(2)

The indicators kl, duda, pseudot2, beale, frey and mcclain require a clustering for max.nc+1 classes. If these key figures are to be calculated, this clustering must be specified in cls.

(3)

The indicator kl requires a clustering for min.nc-1 classes. If this key figure is to be calculated, this clustering must also be specified in cls. For the case min.nc = 2 no clustering for 1 has to be given.

(4)

The following methods can be used to create clusterings:

"ward.D", "single", "complete", "average", "mcquitty" 
"median," "centroid," "ward.D2," "kmeans," "DBSclustering,"

(5)

The indicators duda, pseudot2, beale and frey are only intended for use in hierarchical cluster procedures.

If a distances matrix is given, then \pkg{ProjectionBasedClustering} is required to be accessible.

# Reading the iris dataset from the standard R-Package datasets

# Creating the clusterings for the data set
#(here with method complete) for the number of classes 2 to 8

# Alternatively, the same calculation as above can be executed with the following call
ClusterNoEstimation(Data = data, max.nc = 7, method = "complete")
# In this variant, the function clusterumbers also takes over the clustering
